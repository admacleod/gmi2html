gmi2html
========

**Important note:** I am no longer actively maintaining this repository, it was a simple tool for a simple project that I will not be taking further. If you have an interest in the future of this sort of thing then I suggest you head on over to this excellent fork that really kicks things up a notch with:
- HTML safety
- URL safety
- Tests!
- Being able to use it as a library

Original readme
---------------

Reads [Gemtext](https://geminiprotocol.net/docs/gemtext.gmi) from stdin and writes the HTML equivalent to stdout.

```shell
gmi2html < page.gmi > page.html
```
